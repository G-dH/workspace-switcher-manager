  "description": "Allows to control all available workspaces related options in the Shell, adds some options to workspace switcher and allows to customize appearance and the content of the workspace switcher popup.\nYou can customize timings, size, position, colors and content of the popup. You can also add some information to each workspace box in the popup, independently to the active one and the inactive. You can combine workspace index, name of the workspace (up to 10 names you can define also in this extension) or name of the last used application on the given workspace. You can also change orientation of the popup and you can reduce the popup to display only box with the currently switched workspace, so the popup can, for example, show only a name of the workspace or its index, even without any background if you set the background transparent.",
